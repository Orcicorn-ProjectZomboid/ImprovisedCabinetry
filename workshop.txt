title=Improvised Cabinetry
description=Congratulations, you've survived the end of the world and you're stable and safe in your base. There is only one problem, your cabinets don't match your wallpaper and that's really embarrassing. You can go out and try to find the right type of cabinet but that could be risky and wouldn't it just make a lot more sense to craft some cabinets?

description=Introducing Improvised Cabinetry. With over 40 new recipes and 25 different types of Cabinets and Counters you can play homemaker all day long and finally get your house looking just the way you want it to.  More than half the recipes are automatically learned and just require the appropriate carpentry skill while some of the more industrial counters will need to be taught.

description=Staying in and hiding at home is just a wee bit better with improvised cabinetry.  Finally your counters match the drapes and you are no longer bringing dishonor to your family. Sure the zeds don't seem to care but who asked them anyway?

description=[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
description=You can now craft Counters and Cabinets. They utilize Wood Panels and Cabinet hinges which are crafted with easily acquirable resources. Door hinges randomly spawn in the world as well instead of just being on doors. A ton of cabinets are available by default, but a few industrial cabinets require you to read the magazine to learn them.

description=[h1]Regarding Crafting Cabinets[/h1]
description=It is strongly recommended that you craft then install 1 or 2 cabinets at a time. The game has an issue where when you craft more than you can carry it will drop them to the ground. However, cabinets were never designed to be dropped so they don't have a world model and are completely invisible outside of the loot window. If you craft more than you can carry you will end up with invisible cabinets on the ground. You can still pick them up from the loot window but they can be hard to find.
